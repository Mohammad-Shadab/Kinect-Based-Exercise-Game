# Kinect-Based-Exercise-Game
Based on Body Movement Detection and Analysis.

(For manual, project report, demo and other documentations of this project, please refer to the "documentation" files in this repository.)

This project is designed for heart patients, people who want to do physical exercises as well as for gaming enthusiasts.
It is based on Kinect Skeleton Tracking.
You have to control the body of the game character with your body as a joystick ! Sounds fun right !
There are no strings/controllers/headset attached to the player hence really comfortable to use. All you have to do is to perform free actions according to the game.
The obstacles are designed in such a way that the user automatically performs cardiovascular exercises while enjoying the game.

On starting the game, we have the Main menu .
There are 3 option buttons available namely- ‘ New Game, Options and Quit.’
Clicking on New Game we go straight to level 1. The Kinect maps the limbs , head , torso and shoulders of the real person with the game character automatically .
Person needs to dodge the obstacles coming at him by doing appropriate actions.

In level 1, person has to walk past the obstacles. Thus level 1 is a basic warm up but with a whole new Experience of walking/running !
It is quite enjoyable and beneficial ! 

Level 2 is a bit more difficult and is designed for exercise of upper body and neck.
